# D and A

Welcome to my **D and A** repository! This is where I practice and explore data structures and algorithms using the following programming languages:

- Java
- Ruby
- Kotlin
- Python

## Overview
In this repository, you'll find:
- Implementations of various data structures and algorithms.
- Corresponding test files for each implementation.
- Practice questions and solutions based on specific data structures and algorithms.

Some of the practice questions are inspired by the following textbooks:
1. *Big Java* by Cay Horstmann
2. *Java™ Programming: From Problem Analysis to Program Design* by D.S. Malik

## Structure
The repository is organized by language and topic. Each folder contains:
- Implementation files.
- Test files to validate the functionality.


## Goals
This repository is part of my ongoing journey to:
- Deepen my understanding of data structures and algorithms.
- Sharpen my problem-solving skills.
- Practice writing clean, efficient, and testable code in multiple languages.

## Contributions
This repository is primarily for personal practice, but feel free to check it out. If you have suggestions or improvements, I’d be happy to hear them!

Thank you for visiting!
